description: The previous financial years in this dataset have been adjusted to
  be comparable with the departments as they are structured in the current Medium
  Term Expenditure Framework. This means historical data for departments might
  not reflect the structure of the department when that expenditure took place,
  but rather as the functions are distributed among the departments at the time
  of this budget.
